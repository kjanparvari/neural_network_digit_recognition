# Handwritten Digit Recognition  

A simple neural network implemented from scratch using **NumPy** to recognize handwritten digits. This project was developed as part of the **Computational Intelligence course** at **Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)** and focuses on understanding the inner workings of neural networks.  

## Features  
- **Custom Neural Network Implementation**: Built from scratch without any high-level machine learning libraries.  
- **MNIST Dataset**: Trained and tested on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.  
- **Backpropagation and Gradient Descent**: Includes manual implementation of these core algorithms.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization)  

## Purpose  
This project provides a hands-on understanding of neural networks by implementing key components like forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent from the ground up.
